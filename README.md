# my-sublime-config
My Sublime Text configurations. I use this repo to sync my many machines.
Got the process from [Andreas MÃ¼ller's article](https://devmount.medium.com/using-git-to-sync-sublime-text-settings-f70b8dc7a40d).

Feel free to take some if you want, and adapt as much as you want. This is released under the Unilicence but could as well be released under [the do what you want licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL). I really don't care.
